        description: "A cold swimming pool is an unused swimming pool and in most areas swimming pools are too cold to use throughout the year and therefore heating is required. A particularly effective solution is a    SP Heat Pump that utilises energy from two sources, heat from the ambient air and electric power to run a compressor in a reverse refrigeration cycle, the compression process extracting heat from the ambient air for transfer to the pool through a heat exchanger. All models are highly efficient operating at a Coefficient of Performance (COP), which is the ratio of energy output to direct energy input of up to six times for the SPS fixed output capacity units, depending on environmental conditions.",
