The inverters convert the PV generated DC power to AC, either single or three-phase depending on the model, and feed to the applied load prioritizing the PV output, supplementing with AC mains power if there is insufficient PV generated output. Inverters are fitted with MPPT trackers to optimize output efficiency and they are designed to be connected in parallel, each fed from dedicated solar arrays that can provide power outputs of limitless size. WIFI monitoring devices and Huawei Smartlogger are also provided for monitoring and controlling the power to the grid.",

In hybrid PV/mains supply mode power input is principally provided from the PV source supplemented by the battery which is charged from the mains and during periods of non-PV output the system automatically switches to mains power. Conditioned pure sine wave output power is provided in every output mode that is suitable for small electronic equipment. The systems are applicable in all residential and small-scale applications and are the ideal solution for reliable and consistent power supply. Systems are scalable up to 30kWh battery capacity through connection of multiple units.",

The key is effective system controllers, and by using the latest technology inverters, PV power output can be synchronized with the mains grid power supply to provide an efficient hybrid system that directly utilizes all the PV power being generated with the balance of the network requirement being provided from the grid. Capacity is determined by the output of the solar array and the specification of the inverter, with systems up to 100kW being available. Basic systems provide no battery back-up and are dependent upon mains supply availability, though back-up batteries and a separate control inverter can also be specified that will provide power in all conditions.",
