Options are available for Open Loop and Closed Loop systems, Open Loop heating the water directly through the collector and Closed Loop separating the collector flow water from the through flow water, heat being transferred through the tank jacket. This is suitable for mineralised and brackish water that may corrode or scale the collector's capillaries.",

They feature a series of glass heat pipes that consist of two sealed concentric glass tubes with a vacuum created in the void between to aid efficient heat transfer. A copper rod is inserted into the inner tube void which projects into a header manifold, the void being filled with water to optimise heat transfer and sealed at its end. The consumption water flows through the manifold and is heated by the projecting copper rod. This water continuously circulates through the storage tank on the thermosyphon principal thus heating the tank contents.",

Solar energy is captured in the vacuum sealed glass void heating the water in the glass tube. The heated water rises to the top of the pipe and collects in the tank. The large surface area of the vacuum tube and high water turbulence within the internal chamber provide rapid transfer of heat to the water flowing through the tank. The sealed evacuated tubes and tri-oxide coating provide maximum solar gain even in the coldest areas and during cloudy or overcast days.",

        description: "HPW Heat Pump Hot Water Systems are designed for all domestic water heating applications that utilise the high efficiency benefits of heat pump technology. The integral systems combine a hot water storage tank with an efficient heat pump that generates heat from ambient air by utilising the natural heat generating phenomenon of the gas evaporation/condensation cycle. This is transferred to the stored water by circulation through a coil type heat exchanger in the tank. Tank construction is carbon steel with internal enamel coating and a magnesium anode is fitted for cathodic protection against corrosion. The tank is lined with high grade thermal insulation for heat retention.",
