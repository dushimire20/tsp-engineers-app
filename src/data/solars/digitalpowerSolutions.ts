Inverters are fitted with MPPT trackers to optimise output efficiency and they are designed to be connected in parallel each fed from dedicated solar arrays that can provide power outputs of limitless size. WIFI monitoring devices and Huawei Smartlogger are also provided for monitoring and controlling the power to the grid.",

In hybrid PV/mains supply mode power input is principally provided from the PV source supplemented by the battery which is charged from the mains and during periods of non PV output the system automatically switches to mains power. Conditioned pure sine wave output power is provided in every output mode that is suitable for small electronic equipment. The systems are applicable in all residential and small scale applications and are the ideal solution for reliable and consistent power supply. Systems are scalable upto 30kWh battery capacity through connection of multiple units.",
