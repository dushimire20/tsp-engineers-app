The inverters convert the PV generated DC power to AC, either single or three phase depending on model, and feed to the applied load prioritizing the PV output, supplementing with AC mains power if there is insufficient PV generated output. Inverters are fitted with MPPT trackers to optimise output efficiency and they are designed to be connected in parallel each fed from dedicated solar arrays that can provide power outputs of limitless size. WIFI monitoring devices and Huawei Smartlogger are also provided for monitoring and controlling the power to the grid.",

In hybrid PV/mains supply mode power input is principally provided from the PV source supplemented by the battery which is charged from the mains and during periods of non PV output the system automatically switches to mains power. Conditioned pure sine wave output power is provided in every output mode that is suitable for small electronic equipment. The systems are applicable in all residential and small scale applications and are the ideal solution for reliable and consistent power supply. Systems are scalable upto 30kWh battery capacity through connection of multiple units.",

A key feature is automatic restart every 10 mins in the event of low insolation.Pump components are manufactured from high-quality engineering plastics with Santoprene used for the diaphragm and EPDM for the valves. Pump casings is stainless steel and a 50-mesh stainless steel screen. Pumps can be installed either with a direct connection to the PV module or through a charge controller that is connected to a battery for 24hr operation. Pump output will be determined by the PV module input power available.",
